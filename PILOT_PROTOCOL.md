# Pilot Study Protocol (outline) - Microbiome & Cancer Treatment AE Prediction

## Objective

Pilot prospective observational study to collect stool microbiome samples and clinical data from cancer patients receiving immunotherapy or chemotherapy to evaluate model performance for predicting treatment-related adverse events (AEs).

## Design

- Prospective cohort of N=200 patients at single center.
- Stool sample at baseline (pre-treatment) and at first cycle (day 14) and at AE onset (if any).
- Clinical data: labs, medications, demographics, treatment details, AE recording (CTCAE).

## Ethics

- IRB approval required. Informed consent required including genomic data use and storage.
- Data de-identification and secure storage enforced.

## Outcomes

- Primary: occurrence of grade>=3 treatment-related AE within first 90 days.
- Secondary: time-to-AE, AE type stratification, model explainability.

## Data Sharing

- De-identified and aggregated results may be published; raw sequencing data remains under controlled access per DTA.
